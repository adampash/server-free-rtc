server-free-rtc
===============

WebRTC enables modern browsers to create encrypted, peer-to-peer data and media communication, but it requires a signaling method to get two peers talking. Unfortunately that normally means a third-party server needs to be involved, and suddenly things don't feel quite as secure and private. 

This small experiment allows two users to start a peer-to-peer video chat by exchanging strings of text and setting up the chat by whatever means they prefer (e.g., email, IM, etc.).
